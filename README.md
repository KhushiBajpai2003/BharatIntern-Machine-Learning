TASK 1 - HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL

Introduction

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to predict prices of the houses based on some features. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of the house based on their features.

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy Pandas Seaborn Matplotlib Model Training The code for training the classification model can be found in the House Price Predictor.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Random Forest model is trained using the House dataset and evaluated for its accuracy Testing After training the model, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains different entries for features and it predicted the accurate price for those House, and their accuracy is evaluated.

TASK -2 Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each having distinct measurement characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset is available in the repository as iris.csv.

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

NumPy Pandas Seaborn Matplotlib Model Training The code for training the classification models can be found in the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Three different models are trained:

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Logistic Regression Decision Tree Classifier Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy Testing After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated. #########################################################################
